# Exploring API's - CSC207 Project Proposal

## Problem Domain

A personalized and socially-connected digital cookbook.

Description:

Our application will be a platform where users can save recipes from online, write their
own recipes and share their recipes with their friends. Features include:
- being able to organize their saved recipes by cuisine, type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
and diet restrictions
- being able to input ingredients, and getting a list of all saved recipes that can be
made with those ingredients
- being able to tag and comment on your own recipes
- being able to like and review your friends' recipes
