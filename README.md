## Problem Domain

A personalized and socially-connected digital cookbook.

Description:

Our application will be a platform where users can search and save recipes, and make
customized meal plans as well as shopping lists. Features include:

- a fridge template for users to write the ingredients they have at home

- being able to search for recipes from the database, with filters such as 
  - Type of cuisine
  - Type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
  - Time taken to make the recipe
  - Calorie count
  - Dietary restrictions (ingredient exclusions)

- being able to output a filtered recipe which has the least number of missing ingredients

- being able to generate a shopping list based on the list of missing recipes

- being able to save a recipe and put it into an organized "meal plan" list 
which includes what 'day' and 'meal time' they plan on making this meal

Note: A recipe file would include: a short description, ingredients, prep/cook time, calories, taste, etc.
